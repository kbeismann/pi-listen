/**
 * Widget ownership model for the v7.1 Settings UI redesign — §1 of the
 * approved plan, hardened across v3/v4/v5 reviews.
 *
 * Why this exists: `ctx.ui.setWidget(key, content)` writes to a key-slotted
 * store. Two widgets with different keys coexist; two widgets with the
 * same key overwrite. v7.1 introduces install + playback widgets that
 * must coexist with the persistent voice-input state row, so we need a registry that
 * (a) prevents same-key collision, (b) lets completed widgets evict
 * themselves so the registry doesn't leak across long sessions, and
 * (c) survives misbehaving widgets that throw on disposal.
 *
 * The contract was reviewed and SHIP'd by both Codex and Gemini at v5.
 * Six load-bearing properties of the implementation:
 *
 *   1. `register(w)` synchronously calls `existing.dispose()` before
 *      swapping in `w`, so a same-key handover never races.
 *   2. `unregister(key, owner)` is OWNER-CHECKED — only deletes the Map
 *      entry if it currently points to `owner`. A stale dispose path
 *      (e.g. an old install widget's queued cleanup running after a
 *      newer same-key widget was registered) cannot evict the
 *      successor.
 *   3. `disposeAll()` iterates a CLONED snapshot of values, because
 *      each widget's `dispose()` will synchronously call back into
 *      `unregister(key, this)`, mutating the underlying Map.
 *   4. Each `dispose()` call inside `disposeAll()` is wrapped in
 *      `try/catch` so one throwing widget cannot abort cleanup for
 *      the rest.
 *   5. `installWidgetKey(modelId)` produces per-model-id keys so two
 *      installs for different models occupy different slots.
 *   6. The base class's `dispose()` ordering — set `disposed` true
 *      before any cleanup work — is enforced via `BaseDisposableWidget`,
 *      so subclasses cannot accidentally clear timers / slots before
 *      flipping the flag.
